To compile the MSCGFM 1.1 package, go to the src/ directory, copy an appropriate Makefile 
template from the Make/ subdirectory, change the library and include paths as necessary 
for your machine, and then run 'make all' to get the executables rangefinder.x
and newfm.x.

This package requires 3 nonstandard libraries: LAPACK, the GNU scientific library 
(v 1.15+), and the Gromacs XTC library. All are available for download free of charge and 
are easy to find with an internet search by name.
