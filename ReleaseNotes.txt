Release Notes
=============
Version 1.5.1 (September 2, 2016)
	* Added combinefm.x
		** Updated Makefiles
		** Added "batch_fm" example
	* Changed reading behavior when processing last frame
	* Lammps reading recognizing position labels "xu" in addition to "x"
	* Updated Manual

Version 1.5.2 (September 15, 2016)
	* Corrected matrix error for combinefm.x
		** Updated "batchfm" example outputs
